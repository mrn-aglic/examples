# Minio bucket skeleton

This folder contains a skeleton for setting up
minio in other projects.

I first learned about Minio from Data Pipelines with Apache
Airflow (I actually think that I expanded on it a fair
amount).
The code for the book is here:

You can get the book here:

The shell commands in the book are given in the docker-compose
file. I extracted them to the `entrypoint.sh` file and expanded
the file a bit.
